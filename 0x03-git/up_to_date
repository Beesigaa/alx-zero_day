TO UPDATE LOCAL REPO:
$ git fetch origin
# Fetches updates made to an online repository
$ git merge origin YOUR_BRANCH_NAME
# Merges updates made online with your local work

OR
$ git pull origin YOUR_BRANCH_NAME
# Grabs online updates and merges them with your local work





TO CREATE A BRANCH:

$ git branch (to check which branch you are on)
$ git branch branch_name (to create a new branch)
$ git checkout branch_name to switch too a new branch

The git push command takes two arguments:

A remote name, for example, origin
A branch name, for example, main
For example:

git push REMOTE-NAME BRANCH-NAME



DELETING A BRANCH:
git push REMOTE-NAME :BRANCH-NAME
Note that there is a space before the colon. The command resembles the same steps you'd take to rename a branch. However, here, you're telling Git to push nothing into BRANCH-NAME on REMOTE-NAME. Because of this, git push deletes the branch on the remote repository.

TO RENAME A BRANCH:
$ git push REMOTE-NAME LOCAL-BRANCH-NAME:REMOTE-BRANCH-NAME
To rename a branch, you'd use the same git push command, but you would add one more argument: the name of the new branch. For example above. This pushes the LOCAL-BRANCH-NAME to your REMOTE-NAME, but it is renamed to REMOTE-BRANCH-NAME.
